# Standard library provided by the CLI
Here's a reference of the standard library provided with the CLI.

The classes, objects, methods, functions provided by the following modules are only available when running the CLI. They aren't part of the core language.
You may include one or more of these components when embedding Swan in your own program, but it isn't done by default. IF not otherwise specified, modules are independant from eachother.

Alphabetical list of modules available in the CLI:

- [FS](module-fs.md): Filesystem, path, files and directories manipulation
- [IO](module-io.md): Basic I/O module to read/write UTF-8 encoded text files
- [Thread](module-thread.md): basics for multithreading
