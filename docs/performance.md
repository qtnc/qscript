# Performances
I took the recursive fibonacci test at  [scriptorium](https://github.com/r-lyeh-archived/scriptorium) as a reference for benchmarking.

According to my tests on my own machine: lua 5.1.4 = 1.689sec vs. QScript = 2.511sec, 
I obtain 67 points, what places QScript in rank #17 out of 50. This isn't a bad score.
By comparison, CPython 3.6 is slower with 2.880s, which makes 59 points.

Be careful though, benchmarks never represent the reality; don't expect these numbers to stay true in the real life.
